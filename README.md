## Documentation

The project documentation is automatically generated by github and served at this [page](https://tschmoderer.github.io/cpp-linear-algebra-toolbox/html/index.html). 

Nevertheless, you can generate (UNIX only) the documentation using the target 

```bash
(Require) sudo apt install -y doxygen graphviz plantuml
make docs
```

 which will compile the documentation and open your browser to display the main page.
